;;; Author: Ludovic Courtès

;;; Commentary:
;;;
;;; A tiny benchmark that compares the time taken to read (just read, not
;;; load) standard Guile Scheme files with Guile's built-in reader and with
;;; the reader from `guile-reader' that's returned by `default-reader'.
;;;
;;; Code:


;; Sample files
(define %files-to-load
  (map %search-load-path
       '("ice-9/boot-9.scm"  "ice-9/common-list.scm"
	 "ice-9/format.scm"  "ice-9/optargs.scm"
	 "ice-9/session.scm" "ice-9/getopt-long.scm")))

;; Number of iterations reading files.  Adjust this as a function of your
;; machine's CPU power.
(define %iterations 30)

      (let loop ((sexp (reader)))
