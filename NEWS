    * Fix compilation with GCC 4.5.

New in Guile-Reader 0.6

  * Guile-Reader is now distributed under GPLv3 or later (instead of
    GPLv2 or later).

  * New token reader for R6RS-style syntax quotes: #', #`, and #,.

  * `make-guile-reader' returns a reader that understands SRFI-62
    s-exp comments, R6RS-style syntax quotes, and s-exps introduced by
    square brackets.  All these are supported by default by `read' in
    Guile 2.0.

  * On Guile 2.0, non-ASCII Unicode symbols, strings, characters, and
    Skribe-expressions are correctly read.

  * On Guile 2.0, Scheme source files are compiled and installed.

  * Bugs fixed

    * Add support for rationals in the number token reader.
